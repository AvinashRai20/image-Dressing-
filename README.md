# image-Dressing-
This project allows users to upload their image and virtually try on different clothes. After uploading a photo, users can select or add clothing items, which are then automatically applied to the uploaded image using AI-based image processing. The system generates a realistic output showing how the selected clothes look on the userâ€™s image.
